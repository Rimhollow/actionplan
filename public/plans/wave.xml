	  <AudioStreams>
      Each audio stream contained in the WAVE file is normalized into an
      uncompressed PCM(LPCM) audio stream with a sample size of 16 bits/sample.
      The normalized audio stream will have the same sample rate (samples/second) as the original 
      audio stream in the WAVE files.

  <significant-properties>
    WAVE exhibits the following significant properties (note 1). They are the significant properties which
    the FDA intends to preserve when adopting migration policy in the future.
    <content>
      Duration and number of channels.
    </content>
    <context>
      Title and creating application information.
    </context>
    <behavior>
      N/A
    </behavior>
    <structure>
      Channel relationship (channel mapping).
    </structure>
    <appearance>
      Sampling frequency and bit-depth.
    </appearance>
  </significant-properties>
  <long-term-strategy>
    <original>
      Migrate to newer WAVE versions or to an open, standardized and well supported audio file
      format that is to be a good successor for the WAVE file format.
    </original>
    <normalized>
      Normalized version will not be migrated.
      <normalized-audio>Migrate to an open, standardized and well supported audio stream format that is losslessly compressed.</normalized-audio>
