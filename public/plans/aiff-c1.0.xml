		<original>
			If a normalized version was created for the original, then the original will be    				preserved in bit-level
               only. If a normalized version was not created for the original, migrate the original to a non-    			lossy,
		open audio format when one is found is to be a good successor to the AIFF-C format.
		</original>
		<normalized>
			Migrate the normalized version to its successor format (when one is determined to be the
		successor).
