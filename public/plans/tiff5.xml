	<significant-properties>
		TIFF 5.0 exhibits the following significant properties (note 1). They are the significant properties which
		the FDA intends to preserve when adopting migration policy in the future.
		<content>
			Image width and image height.
		</content>
		<context>
			Creating application information.
		</context>
		<behavior>
			N/A
		</behavior>
		<structure>
			If a TIFF file contains multiple images, the sequence of the images in the TIFF file
			wil be preserved.
		</structure>
		<appearance>
			X sampling frequency, Y sampling frequency, samples per pixel, bits per sample
			and extra samples.
		</appearance>

	<original>
      See the long-term preservation strategy for TIFF 6.0 images. TIFF 5.0 images will be treated in 
      the archive as if they were TIFF 6.0 images because of their similarity.
