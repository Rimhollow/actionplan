    <original>
      Migrate to newer AVI versions or to an open, standardized and well supported multimedia file
      format that is to be a good successor for the AVI file format.
      No normalized version will be created for AVI 1.0 files. However, each video/audio stream
      contained in the AVI file will be normalized according to the Action Plan for FDA Supported
      Video/Audio Stream Formats. If the encoded video/audio stream is not in the list of FDA
      supported video/audio stream formats for AVI file format, the video/audio stream will not be
      normalized and it will be preserved as bit-level.
    </original>

    <normalized>
      Not applicable for AVI 1.0 file format. For the normalized video and audio stream formats,
      please see the Action Plan for FDA Supported Video/Audio Stream Formats.
