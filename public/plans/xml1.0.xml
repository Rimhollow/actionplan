    <xmlresolution>
	  Yes. An xmlresolution tarball will be created for all XML files in a package if they
      contain at least one named reference to an external schema/DTD/stylesheet and
      the reference can be resolved to a physical file.

    <context>
      Yes. Contextual information described in XML documents will be preserved.
    </context>
    <behavior>
      External schema referenced by XML documents will be preserved. The
